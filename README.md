Power BI Dashboard: Heart Attack Risk Analysis
By: Mohammad Al Bayyari

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This Power BI Dashboard was designed to analyze heart attack risk factors using synthetic patient data. The project focused on demographics, cholesterol levels, and high-risk conditions (smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol) to identify trends and support preventative healthcare strategies.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The objective was to answer three critical healthcare-related questions that could help clinicians, researchers, and policymakers identify high-risk patients and tailor interventions accordingly.

ðŸ”¹ Key Questions & Insights from the Dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Question 1: What is the demographic distribution of heart attack cases across age and gender?
ðŸ’¡ Business Impact: Helps tailor healthcare programs based on high-risk age groups and gender-specific risk trends.

âœ… Insights from the Dashboard:
Heart attacks are most prevalent in patients aged 40-59, with the highest number of cases observed in the 40-49 and 50-59 age groups.
Men have significantly higher heart attack rates than women, indicating a gender disparity in cardiovascular health risks.
A slicer was added to dynamically filter by age ranges, allowing further demographic segmentation.
ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features:
âœ” Bar Chart (Age Group vs. Heart Attacks) â†’ Displays the number of heart attack cases per age range.
âœ” Bar Chart (Gender vs. Heart Attacks) â†’ Compares cases between males and females.
âœ” Age Range Slicer â†’ Enables dynamic filtering for deeper analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Question 2: How do cholesterol levels impact heart attack risk, and what are the safe thresholds?
ðŸ’¡ Business Impact: Supports clinicians in setting cholesterol management guidelines to reduce heart attack risk.

âœ… Insights from the Dashboard:
The histogram analysis shows that most heart attack patients had total cholesterol levels between 180-250 mg/dL.
Patients with cholesterol above 240 mg/dL were at the highest risk, aligning with real-world medical guidelines for high cholesterol.
Conditional formatting in the patient table highlights individuals with dangerously high cholesterol, making it easy to identify at-risk patients.
ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features:
âœ” Histogram (Cholesterol vs. Heart Attack Cases) â†’ Shows the cholesterol distribution of heart attack patients.
âœ” Conditional Formatting in Table â†’ Highlights patients with high cholesterol in red.
âœ” Quartile Ranges for Cholesterol â†’ Defined in the legend to show safe vs. dangerous levels.

ðŸ“Œ Question 3: What percentage of high-risk patients (diabetics, smokers, high cholesterol) have not yet had a heart attack?
ðŸ’¡ Business Impact: Helps identify at-risk patients before a heart attack occurs, enabling preventative interventions.

âœ… Insights from the Dashboard:
399 patients were identified as "high-risk" due to smoking, diabetes, or high cholesterol.
318 high-risk patients have NOT yet had a heart attack, meaning 79.7% of high-risk patients could still benefit from preventative care.
The pie chart shows the breakdown of high-risk factors, indicating that high cholesterol is the most common risk factor, followed by smoking and diabetes.
ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features:
âœ” KPI Cards â†’ Display total high-risk patients, high-risk patients without a heart attack, and the percentage of high-risk patients without a heart attack.
âœ” Pie Chart (Risk Factor Breakdown) â†’ Shows the proportion of smokers, diabetics, and high cholesterol patients.
âœ” Filtered Table (At-Risk Patients Without a Heart Attack) â†’ Displays patient details with risk factors.

ðŸ”¹ Additional Features Implemented
âœ” Custom Data Transformation: Created a unique Patient_ID using Power Query to ensure each patient was identifiable.
âœ” Dynamic Filtering: Added slicers for age range to allow detailed segmentation of heart attack cases.
âœ” Data Visualization Enhancements: Applied color coding & conditional formatting to make risk levels visually clear.
âœ” KPI Indicators for Quick Insights: Designed KPI cards to show key risk statistics at a glance.
